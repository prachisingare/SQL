📚 What You Will Learn
This repository walks through a wide range of topics in SQL, starting from basics to more advanced query techniques:

🔹 1. Creating Tables
Use of CREATE TABLE with appropriate data types

Defining Primary Keys, Foreign Keys, and Constraints

🔹 2. Inserting Records
Syntax and structure of INSERT INTO statements

Populating realistic data into employee, student, and customer tables

Applying conditions using:

Comparison operators (=, !=, <, >)

Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)

Range and set operators (BETWEEN, IN, LIKE)

🔹 5. Sorting with ORDER BY
Sorting output data in ascending or descending order

Sorting on single and multiple columns

🔹 6. Aggregating Data
Use of aggregate functions:

COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX()

Combining aggregates with GROUP BY and HAVING

🔹 7. Joining Tables
Understanding and using:

INNER JOIN

LEFT JOIN

RIGHT JOIN

FULL OUTER JOIN

Practical multi-table queries (e.g., employee-department joins)

🔹 8. Subqueries
Nested queries in WHERE, FROM, or SELECT clauses

Correlated subqueries for dynamic filtering

🔹 9. Set Operations
Using UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT (where supported)

🔹 10. Use of Aliases and Expressions
Creating readable and calculated columns using aliases

Performing arithmetic operations in queries

📁 Practice Scenarios Included
